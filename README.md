# Angular Security Workshop

This is the awesome workshop to learn how to add Authentication to your Angular app :)

## Running it

To run the frontend, just serve the content on port `3000`.

## Challenges

These are the challenges for the first module. The goal is to familiarize ourselves with *ui-router*, *angular-storage* and *route change events*.
 
HINT: We are only simulating an exchange with a server. We will cover server-side communication in a later module.
